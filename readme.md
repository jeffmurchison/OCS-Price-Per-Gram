## Depreciated

This extension was created when the OCS website was in its infancy and lacked many features. They have added $/g prices on product pages natively now so there is no need for this extension. This repo will be kept for reference.

## About

**Description:** A Google Chrome extension to show the $/g on OCS product pages. This project is retired and won't see any further development since the OCS now natively shows price per gram.
